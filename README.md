A compiler for a subset of BASIC called [Tiny-BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_BASIC)

Inspired by [Austin Henley's Python-based compiler](https://austinhenley.com/blog/teenytinycompiler1.html) for the same language. Focusing here on the following:
- Lexical analysis
- Syntactic analysis
- Recursive descent parsing
- Abstract syntax tree
- Semantic analysis
